# bitlab-java-ee-projects
Compilation of all tasks from Bitlab Java EE Course. There are tasks that include servlets, JSPs, PostgreSQL and other technologies;

The tasks are deployed on a local Tomcat server, so there is no way to use these tasks remotely. Only using a local server on your computer. But all the functions work perfectly, so you can use snippets without any fear/doubt :) ;

Note: To open a specific task, just enter the URL 'lecXtaskY' (X is the lecture number, Y is the task number in this lecture). For SPRINT tasks, use 'sprintX' (X is the sprint task number). Mapping details in web.xml;

DB Note: I used PostgreSQL in this project, it may require a superuser login and password. In my case, these are 'postgres' (user) and 'xodbar' (user password);
